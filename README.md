# fyne-print
Add printing to the fyne toolkit.

The intent is to eventually move this to fyne-x, but it will need to go through alpha and beta testing before that can occur.
Otherwise, there would probalby be many updates to fyne-x as bugs get worked out.

## Building fyne-print

### Linux

For Linux, you will need the cups dev library. On Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libcups2-dev
```
